Last month, I participated in a Piscine at 42 Porto.

The Piscine is an intensive 26-day introduction to programming in C designed to push problem-solving, logic, and coding skills to the limit.

It's a project-based, peer-to-peer learning experience and you need to pass it in order to be admitted to the school.

This repository contains my solutions to the 42 Piscine exercises.
